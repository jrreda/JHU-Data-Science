## Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.


## Attribute Information:

For each record it is provided:

- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 

- Its activity label.

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.



## About R script

R code "run_analysis.R" performs the 5 following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work):

1. Reading datasets 
	. Reading train datasets (X_train, y_train, sub_train)
	. Reading test datasets (X_test, y_test, sub_test)
	. Reading data description (features.txt)

2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	. mean(): Mean value
	. std(): Standard deviation

4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

6. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject



## Tidy Dataset columns
the dataset has 181 observation of  68 variables.
